## 🏗️ Architecture

Tracer is built using a clean architecture approach with the BLoC pattern for state management:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components and screens
- **Business Logic Layer**: BLoCs managing app state and business rules
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases, entities, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, data sources, and models
